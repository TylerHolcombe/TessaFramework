# Tessa Framework
##### _Development of the framework is currently in-progress. Please expect major, breaking changes to the API!_

The Tessa Framework is a small, *highly opinionated* set of annotations and utility code designed to simplify the development of RESTful Webservices and Event-based applications. 

The framework strives to present a set of core functionality with opinionated defaults to reduce, and in some cases eliminte, the boilerplate heavy burdens of configuration, transaction management, exception handling, security, and validations.
 

#### Our Goals for the Framework, in Order of Importance, are:
* Opinionated: Our intent is to provide a simple default way to rapidly achieve common functionality.
* Small: We strive to minimize the amount of code necessary to enable our core functionality.
* Non-Restrictive: If an edge case prevents following the opinionated approach, we won't stand in your way.
* Non-Dependent: As much as we can, we avoid forcing consumers to depend on or inherit from the framework.
* Verbose: We aim to simplify the tasks of monitoring, supporting, and debugging applications via automated logging.

#### The Primary Functionalities of the Framework:
* Simplified transaction management automatically handling:
  * Extracting contextual information from request headers and/or classes
  * Mapping error details to generate and return corresponding REST error responses.
  * Logging of request, response, contextual, error, timing, and event data.
* Integrated Identity and Authorization management including:
  * JWT-based security featuring issuance of public request tokens and private/internal authorization tokens.
  * Options for rotating secrets for use in decoding JWT tokens.
  * Annotations and Utility classes to simplify checking user has roles and/or events.
* Environment based property files with defaults for simple configuration management.
* Simple (one-line) integration with other services developed on the Tessa Framework.
* Highly verbose, automated logging of transaction/event details.
* Utility classes for common functionality such as validations

## Installation and Using the Framework
Detailed reference documentation can be found in the wiki.

To quickly import the framework into your project, add the following dependency into your pom:

###### _(As mentioned earlier, development is still in progress. Please expect major, breaking changes to the API.)_
```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.tessatech.tessa.framework</groupId>
	<artifactId>tessa-framework</artifactId>
	<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```


## Building from Source
We recommend building from source to stay up to date on the latest version. This can be done via executing a maven build on the projects root directory though the command:

```
$ mvn clean install
```
